h3. Geshi Helper Plugin

This plugin provides a simple helper for adding GeSHI syntax highlighting to
your application.

h3. Installation

Either clone the repository or download a package and place it in a @Geshi@
directory in one of your plugin paths.  For example @app/Plugin/Geshi@.

Don't forget that starting with CakePHP 2.0, you must load plugins manually
in @app/Config/bootstrap.php@. For example, CakePlugin::loadAll()

h3. Usage

To use the helper, include the helper in your controller:

	public $helpers = array('Geshi.Geshi');

h4. Methods

**highlight($html)**

This method will scan HTML for @<pre>@ blocks with a known lang attribute.  This
method is good for highlighting code samples in blog posts, or wiki pages.

You can indicate the language of the text in a @<pre>@ block by setting the lang
attribute.  For example:

	<pre lang="php">
	<?php
	echo 'hi'
	</pre>

Will be highlight as php code.

**highlightText($text, $language)**

This method will highlight @$text@ in @$language@.  Use this method to 
highlight text in any language GeSHI supports.

**highlightTextWithStyleSheet($text, $language)**

This method is as above, but also generates inline CSS to support GeSHi's
ability to do so.

h4. Configuration

You can configure GeSHI's default features by changing the public $features
variable in @app/Plugin/Geshi/View/Helper/GeshiHelper.php@.

More interestingly you can configure GeSHI's features from within your views
by accessing the $features variable so: $this->Geshi->features = array(...)

$this->Geshi->features = array ( 'geshi_feature_name' => array ( geshi_parameter, list, values);

Note: previous support for a single @geshi.php@ in you @app/Config@ directory
has been dropped due to the limited flexibility that it offered.
